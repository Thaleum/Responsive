Responsive Webpages assignment
I used the same pics and img srs assignments from the previous assignment
I know something is wrong with the container width and the vertical alignment when the screen width is shrunken, but I couldn't figure it out. I'll keep looking at it
Other than that I just did what was asked and figured one @media screen assignment was enough because if the min device width isn't met than the .box is fine as is
